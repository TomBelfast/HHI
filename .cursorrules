# Cursor Rules for HHI Project

## Font Consistency
- Always use consistent font sizes throughout the application to ensure layout consistency
- Use the same font size for all headers of the same level (h1, h2, h3, h4, etc.)
- When updating font sizes, ensure all similar elements across the application use the same sizing
- Maintain visual hierarchy by using appropriate font size classes (text-sm, text-base, text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl, etc.)
- Avoid mixing different font sizes for the same type of content across different pages or components

## Status and Branch Color Consistency
- Always use consistent color coding for statuses and branches throughout the application
- Use the established color scheme for branches:
  - Belfast: blue (bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-200)
  - Newtownabbey: green (bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200)
  - Lisburn: yellow (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 border-yellow-200)
  - Bangor: red (bg-red-100 text-red-800 border-red-200)
  - Coleraine: purple (bg-purple-100 text-purple-800 border-purple-200)
- Use the established color scheme for user statuses:
  - Active: green (bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200)
  - Inactive: red (bg-red-100 text-red-800 border-red-200)
  - Suspended: gray (bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 border-gray-200)
- Use the established color scheme for project statuses:
  - Completed: green (bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200)
  - In Progress: blue (bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-200)
  - Pending: yellow (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 border-yellow-200)
  - Cancelled: red (bg-red-100 text-red-800 border-red-200)
- Always use Badge component with variant="outline" for status and branch tags
- When adding new statuses or branches, maintain the existing color scheme
- Ensure all tables, cards, and components display statuses and branches with consistent colors

## Universal Tag Color Consistency
- ALL tags throughout the application must use the SAME colors for the SAME values
- When displaying any status, branch, or category tag, use the established color scheme
- Never create different colors for the same tag value in different parts of the application
- All tag colors must be consistent across:
  - Dashboard tables and cards
  - Users page tables and filters
  - Customers page tables and details
  - Projects page tables and forms
  - Analytics charts and tables
  - Reports and any other components
- If a tag appears in multiple places, it MUST have the exact same color everywhere
- Use the centralized color functions (getBranchColor, getStatusColor, etc.) to ensure consistency
- When adding new tag types, define their colors once and reuse them everywhere
- Test that all instances of the same tag value have identical colors across the entire application
